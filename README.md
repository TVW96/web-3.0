# Web-3.0

This website works as a scratch board for my beginning thought of understanding for the evolution of the web. Prior to completing this site I was taught the history of the static web and its issues and then how AJAX was created to modernize the world wide web to a more dynamic system. Immediately after those discoveries I learned of a new system of the web called web 3.0. After few days of research my group memebers and I discvovered that this new form of web traversal was seemingly just a buzzword. All in all project was completed on time and the site is functioning with no errors. There may be a bit of a lack of information but that is because the short amount of time that we were given to complete this project. I would like to comeback to this at some point in the future and design a new website that more suitably represents the vision of web 3.0. To be continued...

This was a group project completed by Troy, Liya, & Aisha during L&D phase of YearUp 2022.
