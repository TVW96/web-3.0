            <h4>The Mona Lisa is a well-known oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci, maybe the most well-known picture in the world.
                it was painted between 1503 and 1519 and is presently housed in Paris' Louvre Musuem. Many explanations have been proposed to
                explain the art piece's fame, but most strong arguments claim that there is no single cause. The painting has become a source of 
                ongoing research and curiosity due to her strange smile and her unknown identity. According to some researchers, her smile is abstract,
                one half of Mona Lisa's smile communicates contentment while the other half lacks emotion. Other say the enigmatic smile is not a smile
                 at all, but rather a solemn expression whose appearance is characteristic of people who have lost their front teeth.

            asking the creator of said art, but many times that is not a realistic option when observing art of the deceased. So trial and error 
            are said to be the true judge of authenticity.
